<h1 align="center"> 👾 Hey, I'm <code>spawncreeper</code> — accidental overachiever, intentional beginner</h1>
<p align="center">
Welcome to my little digital cave of chaos.
</n>
I’m not a Computer Science major. I didn’t grow up coding calculators or building robots out of cereal boxes. But one day I decided I wanted to understand the tech that runs the world — so here I am, learning CS from scratch and documenting every glitch, “aha!” moment, and stack overflow spiral along the way.
</p>
## 📖 What I'm doing

- 📚 Learning CS like a confused but determined NPC
- 🧠 Breaking and rebuilding basic concepts till they click
- 📹 Sharing my unfiltered journey on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@desmosspawncreeper) — from noob-level debugging to “wait, it actually works?!”
- 💻 Pushing buggy code, weird ideas, and mini-projects to GitHub
- 📓 Writing notes that future-me will probably still find confusing

## 🚧 Current Quest Log

- Figuring out how computers even work
- Writing code that doesn’t cry when compiled
- Understanding algorithms without losing sanity
- Occasionally pretending I know Linux

## 🧠 Life goals (subject to change every 2 weeks)

- Build something that breaks the first time and ships the second
- Collaborate with internet strangers who know more than me
- Stay anonymous but somehow win a hackathon

## 🤖 My vibe in one quote:

> "I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m doing it anyway."
